          I have moved to London in September 2015.
          Prior to that, I had extensive experience as an assistant lecturer in
          helping economics professors with various undergraduate courses.
          I further developed my academic and teaching skills during my PhD studies.
          My main qualifications, according to NARIC, include Bachelor’s degree in
          management as well as internationally-accredited MBA, with elements of
          math modelling and finance-related tools. I worked full time for two years as a head
          of marketing department of a major business school.
